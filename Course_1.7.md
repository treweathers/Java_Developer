# Course 1.7: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
## Lesson 1: Creating and Using Classes
### 1. What is a Class in Java?
In Java, a class is a cornerstone tool. It is a blueprint from which we create objects. For example, a `Bicycle` class could include attributes such as `gear` and `speed`, as well as methods such as `applyBrake` and `changeGear`. Just as a caterer uses a recipe to make cookies, we use classes to create objects in programming.

### 2. Creating a Class in Java
The creation of a `class` begins with the class keyword, followed by a unique class name. It's standard in Java for class names to begin with a capital letter. Here's how to define an empty class called `MyClass`:

    class MyClass {
      // class body
    }
To create an object - an instance of the class - we use `new` along with the class name:

    MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
### 3. Methods in a Class
Objects perform actions (or stop them) through methods. A method is a set of instructions that performs an action when executed. In our class, we define a method to display a message. This syntax requires a return type, a name, and parentheses `()`.

    class MyClass {
      // The return type `void` indicates that this showMessage method does not return any value.
      void showMessage() {
        // Print the string "Hello World!" to the console.
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
      }
    }
### 4. Using the Class and its Method
Now, we create an object and call our method. To invoke a method, we use dot notation `.` on the object, followed by the method name and parentheses:

    class MyClass {
      // showMessage method
      void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
      }
      
      public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Create an object from MyClass 
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
    
        // Call the showMessage method
        myObject.showMessage(); // Prints: Hello World!
      }
    }
The program prints `"Hello World!"` to the console. We've now executed a method with an object successfully!

#### Practice #1
Run the code.

    class Automobile {
        void startEngine() {
            System.out.println("The engine is starting!");
        }
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Automobile myCar = new Automobile();
            myCar.startEngine(); // This will print "The engine is starting!"
        }
    }

#### Practice #2
Let's make some tweaks:

Rename the class to Car instead of Automobile;
Add one more class method stopEngine that prints a message about engine stop. Don't forget to call this method afterward!

    class Car {
      // Define a method within the class
      void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Vroom! The car engine starts.");
      }
      void stopEngine() {
        System.out.println("Scrreeeech! The car engine stops.");
      }
    }
    
    class Solution {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the Automobile class
        Car car = new Car();
        
        // Calling the startEngine method on the car object
        car.startEngine(); // It should print: "Vroom! The car engine starts."
        car.stopEngine();
      }
    }

#### Practice #3
Troubleshoot the Car class's startEngine method in the Java simulator. The engine should start with a "Vroom vroom!" message when the method is called correctly. However, due to a bug, the car is not starting as expected. Identify and fix the issue by applying the Java naming conventions and object-oriented principles taught in the lesson.

    class Car {
        void startEngine() {
            System.out.println("The engine has started. Vroom vroom!");
        }
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Car myCar = null;
            myCar.startEngine();
        }
    }
    
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "Car.startEngine()" because "<local1>" is null
    	at Solution.main(solution.java:10)
    
     class Car {
        void startEngine() {
            System.out.println("The engine has started. Vroom vroom!");
        }
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Car myCar = new Car();
            myCar.startEngine();
        }
    }

#### Practice #4
Fill in the blank to make the car do something when we start 

    class Car {
      // TODO: Define a method inside the Car class that prints a message when the car's engine starts.
      void carEngine() {
        System.out.println("Car is explodingðŸ˜µ!");
      }
    }
    
    class Solution {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car(); // Creating an instance of Car class
        myCar.carEngine();;   // TODO: Call the method you've defined in the Car class to start the engine
      }
    }


#### Practice #5
You've learned how to create and use a class and its methods. Now, it's time to apply that knowledge.

Write a Car class with a method to imitate the sound of a horn; then create a Car object and call your method in the main function.

    // TODO: Define a class named 'Car'
        // TODO: In the Car class, define a method 'honk' that prints the sound a car horn makes.
    class Car {
        void honk() {
            System.out.println("honkkkkkkk");
        }
    }
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // TODO: Create a Car object.
            Car myCar = new Car();
            myCar.honk();
            // TODO: Call the method you defined in the Car class to imitate a horn sound.
        }
    }

## Lesson 2: Class Attributes and Methods in Java
### 1. Understanding Class Attributes
Class `attributes` symbolize an object's properties. For instance, the attributes of a `CellPhone` might be its `brand` and `model`:

    public class CellPhone {
        public String brand; // Brand of the phone
        public String model; // Model of the phone
    }
Sometimes, attributes remain constant after initial set-up. The `final` keyword aids in creating such attributes. Let's add a `chargerType` attribute, which will be constant:

    public class CellPhone {
        public String brand;
        public String model;
        public final String chargerType = "Type-C"; // A constant attribute
    }
### 2. Understanding Class Methods
`Methods` are a class's behaviors, while `attributes` are its properties. For our `CellPhone`, a `callDial` method might be used to start a phone call:

    public class CellPhone {
        public String brand = "iPhone";
        public String model = "15 Pro Max";
        public final String chargerType = "Type-C";
    
        public void callDial(long phoneNumber) {
            // Calling the given phone number, including class attributes
            System.out.println("Dialing " + phoneNumber + " from my " + brand + " " + model);
        }
    }
Just as we humans can perform various tasks, our objects can possess more than one method. For instance, let's add another method, `hangUp`:

    public void hangUp() {
        // Call has ended
        System.out.println("Call ended.");
    }
To run this code, we can instantiate a class and call a method for the created instance:

    CellPhone cellPhone = new CellPhone();
    cellPhone.callDial("+1-212-456-7890"); // Prints: Dialing +1-212-456-7890 from my iPhone 15 Pro Max
    cellPhone.hangUp(); // Prints: Call ended.
### 3. Modifying Class Attributes
Methods can interact with and modify class attributes. This can be illustrated with an `updateModel` method that updates the `model`:

    public void updateModel(String newModel) {
        // Updating the model attribute
        this.model = newModel;
        System.out.println("Model updated to " + newModel);
    }
Here, the `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class object. It means that we are setting the `model` field in the current `CellPhone` class object to `newModel`.

#### Practice #1
Run the code.

    // CellPhone class with Class Attributes and Methods.
    class CellPhone {
        String brand = "Galaxy";
        String model = "S21";
        final String chargerType = "Type-C";
    
        void makeCall() {
            System.out.println("Calling from " + brand + " " + model + " using " + chargerType + " charger...");
        }
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            CellPhone myPhone = new CellPhone();
            myPhone.makeCall(); // Invoking the method to simulate making a call.
        }
    }

#### Practice #2
Enhance the CellPhone class by adding an attribute that represents the software version. Then, create a simple updateSoftware method to change this version. This will demonstrate how methods can modify class attributes.

    class CellPhone {
        String brand = "AnyBrand";
        String model = "AnyModel";
        final String chargerType = "MicroUSB";
        String softwareVersion = "v1.0"; // New attribute for software version
        void updateSoftware(String newSoftware) {
            this.softwareVersion = newSoftware;
        }
        // Create a method to update the softwareVersion here        
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            CellPhone myPhone = new CellPhone();
            // Update `myPhone`s software version using the method you created
            myPhone.updateSoftware("v2.0");
            System.out.println(myPhone.softwareVersion);
        }
    }

#### Practice #3
Your mission is to ensure your CellPhone is functional for interstellar communication. There's a slight problem: the code responsible for initiating calls is not using the model and brand variables correctly. Run the code and apply your fresh Java skills to resolve this, ensuring that the phone identifies itself properly when initiating a transmission!

    class CellPhone {
        String brand = "GadgetCo";
        String model = "SuperPhone";
        final String chargerType = "Type-C";
    
        void makeCall() {
            System.out.println("Making a call with the " + callModel + " by " + callBrand + "...");
        }
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            CellPhone myPhone = new CellPhone();
            myPhone.makeCall();
        }
    }
    
    solution.java:7: error: cannot find symbol
            System.out.println("Making a call with the " + callModel + " by " + callBrand + "...");
                                                           ^
      symbol:   variable callModel
      location: class CellPhone
    solution.java:7: error: cannot find symbol
            System.out.println("Making a call with the " + callModel + " by " + callBrand + "...");
                                                                                ^
      symbol:   variable callBrand
      location: class CellPhone
    2 errors
    
    class CellPhone {
        String brand = "GadgetCo";
        String model = "SuperPhone";
        final String chargerType = "Type-C";
    
        void makeCall() {
            System.out.println("Making a call with the " + model + " by " + brand + "...");
        }
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            CellPhone myPhone = new CellPhone();
            myPhone.makeCall();
        }
    }

#### Practice #4
Create a new CellPhone object and call its method to simulate making a call.

    class CellPhone {
        String brand = "TechPhone";
        String model = "X2";
        final String chargerType = "Micro-USB";
    
        // TODO: Write a method 'makeCall' to simulate making a phone call 
        void makeCall() {
            System.out.println("Making a phone call with the " + brand + model + " using a " + chargerType + "charger.");
        }
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // TODO: Create a CellPhone object and call the 'makeCall' method
            CellPhone newCall = new CellPhone();
            newCall.makeCall();
        }
    }

#### Practice #5
Create a CellPhone class with attributes and methods that allow it to dial and hang up a call. This will test your understanding of classes, attributes, and methods in Java.

    class CellPhone {
        // TODO: Define attributes for the brand and model of the phone
        String brand = "iPhone";
        String model = "4";
        // TODO: Create a method `callDial` taking a parameter `long phoneNumber`
        // to simulate dialing a phone number (just print a message to the console)
        void callDial (long phoneNumber) {
            System.out.println("Dialing " + phoneNumber + " on my " + brand + model);
        }    
        // TODO: Create a method `hangUp` to simulate ending a call (just print a message to the console)
        void hangUp () {
            System.out.println("Hanging up...");
        }  
    }
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // TODO: Create an instance of CellPhone and use it to dial a number and then hang up
            CellPhone dial = new CellPhone();
            dial.callDial(+1-234-456-7890);
            dial.hangUp();
        }
    }

## Lesson 3: An Introduction to Java Constructors
### 1. The Syntax of Constructors
Constructors in Java adhere to some specific rules. The name of a constructor must be the same as the class name. Like a method, a constructor has a body enclosed between curly braces `{ }`. A constructor looks like this:

    public class Dog {
      
      String breed; // Attribute 1
      int age; // Attribute 2
      
      // Dog class constructor
      Dog(String breed, int age) {
        this.breed = breed; // Initialize attribute 1
        this.age = age; // Initialize attribute 2
        System.out.println("Initialized Dog class with breed=" + this.breed + " and age=" + this.age);
      } 
    }
In this example, `Dog` is a constructor, taking two parameters - a `String` breed and an `int` age. The `this` keyword refers to the current instance. So `this.breed` refers to the breed attribute of the current dog object, and similarly for age.

### 2. How to Use Constructors
Constructors help us instantiate a class or create an object from a class. They set initial values for object attributes and carry out other functions that are necessary to create the object. Once a constructor is defined, it is automatically called when an object is created.

Here is an example of creating a Dog object, `fido` from the Dog class using a constructor.

    public class Solution {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Create 'fido' using the Dog class constructor
        Dog fido = new Dog("Alsatian", 5); // Prints: Initialized Dog class with breed=Alsatian and age=5
        
        System.out.println(fido.breed);  // prints: Alsatian
        System.out.println(fido.age);  // prints: 5
      }
    }
The expression `Dog fido = new Dog("Alsatian", 5);` follows the format `Class object = new Class(args);`, which creates the `fido` object. It also prints the statement we left in the constructor in the previous section, showing the constructor has actually been called.

### 3. Types of Constructors in Java
There are two main types of constructors in Java:

1. **No-argument constructor**: A constructor that does not take any parameters. Also known as default constructor.

        public class Dog {
          
          String breed;
          int age;
          
          // no-argument constructor
          Dog() {
            breed = "Unknown";
            age = 0;
          }
        }
In this example, if no breed and age are provided when creating a new Dog object, the object will have the breed "Unknown" and age 0.

2. **Parameterized constructor**: A constructor that has parameters.

        public class Dog {
          
          String breed;
          int age;
          
          // parameterized constructor
          Dog(String breed, int age) {
            this.breed = breed;
            this.age = age;
          }
        }
Just like in our first example, the parameterized constructor takes breed and age parameters when you create a new Dog object.

### 4. Brief Introduction to Constructor Overloading
Java supports multiple constructors with distinct parameters. This technique is called constructor overloading. The number and the type of parameters differentiate these constructors.

Here's a `Dog` class featuring constructor overloading:

    public class Dog {
      String breed;
      int age;
      
      // no-arg constructor
      Dog() {
        breed = "Unknown";
        age = 0;
      } 
       
      // parameterized constructor
      Dog(String breed, int age) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.age = age;
      } 
       
      // age-only constructor
      Dog(int age) {
        this.age = age;
        breed = "Unknown";
      }
    }
In the main class, we will call both constructors like this:

    public class Solution {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog1 = new Dog("Husky", 3);
        System.out.println(dog1.breed);  // prints: Husky
        System.out.println(dog1.age);  // prints: 3
    
        Dog dog2 = new Dog(10);
        System.out.println(dog2.breed);  // prints: Unknown
        System.out.println(dog2.age);  // prints: 10
    
        Dog dog3 = new Dog();
        System.out.println(dog3.breed); // prints: Unknown
        System.out.println(dog3.age); // prints: 0
      }
    }
