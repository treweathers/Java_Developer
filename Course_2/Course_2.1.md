# Course 2.1: Hashing, Dictionaries, and Sets in Java
## Lesson 1: Mastering Java HashSet: An In-depth Exploration of Implementation and Complexity Analysis
### 1. Understanding HashSets
A HashSet is an intrinsic part of Java's collections framework. It is designed to store unique elements in an unordered manner. As a class derived from the AbstractSet class and implementing the Set interface, a HashSet doesn't conform to the order in which elements are added. This gives its users the freedom not to maintain any sequencing while ensuring every stored element is distinct.

A HashSet stands out among Set implementations due to its ability to eliminate duplicate data. This makes it highly efficient when we need to swiftly check if an item exists in a collection or when we want to store only the unique data. Let's consider this using a simple Java code snippet:

    import java.util.HashSet;  
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String args[]) {  
            // Instantiate a HashSet
            HashSet<String> set=new HashSet<String>();
            
            // Add elements to HashSet
            set.add("David");
            set.add("Alice");
            set.add("Bob");
            set.add("Alice");
    
            System.out.println(set);  // prints [Bob, Alice, David]
            System.out.println(set.size());  // prints 3
        }  
    } 
In this example, despite adding "Alice" twice to our HashSet, we observe that "Alice" is included only once when we display our set to the console. Note that "Bob" is shown before "David" or "Alice", though it has been added the last. This happens because sets do not preserve the order of the elements.

## 2. HashSet Implementation
Under its hood, a HashSet uses a hash table to manage all its elements. A hash table revolves around an array of buckets that store all items. A hash function is integrated to generate a hash code; the hashed key indicates the memory location where each element gets stored, accelerating the element storage and retrieval process.

In Java, the `add()`, `remove()`, and `contains()` operations in the HashSet class rely on the hash code of the object you're dealing with. When adding or fetching an object, the hashCode method computes a hash that points to a particular bucket where the object will be stored or found.

The ability of a HashSet to mitigate collisions can be demonstrated with the following example:

    import java.util.HashSet;
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<Integer>();
            
            // Add elements to HashSet
            for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
                set.add(i); 
            }
            
            // Access all elements
            for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
                if(set.contains(i)) {
                    System.out.println(i + " found");
                }
            }
        }
    }
In this example, we add numbers from 0 to 99 to the HashSet and then check whether each of these numbers is present in the HashSet. Thanks to the `hashCode` method, the lookup for all these operations is highly efficient, keeping our code execution fast.

### 3. Complexity Analysis of HashSet Operations
The intriguing factor that influences the performance of a HashSet is its time and space complexity. The index of an element is directly computed via the hash function, offering a constant time (O(1)) for adding an element, checking the presence of a component, and removing an element from a HashSet.

The space complexity of a HashSet is linear (O(n)), where n is the number of elements contained in the HashSet. Each element occupies its distinctive bucket.

Consider this Java code:

    import java.util.HashSet;
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<String>();
            
            // Add elements to HashSet
            for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
                set.add("element_" + i); 
            }
    
            // Find elements in HashSet
            for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
                set.contains("element_" + i); 
            }
    
            // Remove elements from HashSet
            for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
                set.remove("element_" + i); 
            }
        }
    }
In the above code, the time to add, find, and remove all elements from the HashSet remains constant, regardless of the size of the HashSet. This showcases the efficiency of HashSet operations.

### 4. Real-world problems that HashSet tackles
A HashSet comes in handy when dealing with large datasets. It provides swift handling operations such as adding elements, verifying whether an item is present in the collection, and deleting items. It's extensively used as the backbone data structure for other advanced data structures, especially in big data management scenarios.

For instance, consider a scenario where we're interested in keeping track of unique visited web pages. A HashSet allows us to add new visited pages quickly and provides an efficient method to check whether a specific page has been visited.

    import java.util.HashSet;
    
    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            HashSet<String> visitedPages = new HashSet<String>();
            
            // Impersonate a user visiting pages
            visitedPages.add("https://example.com");
            visitedPages.add("https://codesignal.com");
    
            // Check if a user accessed https://codesignal.com before
            if (visitedPages.contains("https://codesignal.com")) {
                System.out.println("The user visited https://codesignal.com before");
            }
        }
    }
As we add URLs to the `visitedPages` HashSet when a user lands on a webpage, checking whether a user previously visited a specific page is highly efficient and immediate.

#### Practice #1
Run the code.

    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Initialize a HashSet to store unique visitor IDs for website traffic analysis
            java.util.HashSet<Integer> uniqueVisitors = new java.util.HashSet<Integer>();
    
            // Add visitor IDs (some IDs are duplicates on purpose)
            uniqueVisitors.add(101);
            uniqueVisitors.add(202);
            uniqueVisitors.add(303);
            uniqueVisitors.add(101); // Duplicate ID will not be added
    
            // Print the number of unique visitors recorded
            System.out.println("Unique visitors count: " + uniqueVisitors.size());
        }
    }

#### Practice #2
Check if visitor3@example.com has ever visited our site before. Use the contains method to find out, and print the result in one line.

    class Solution {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            java.util.HashSet<String> uniqueVisitors = new java.util.HashSet<String>();
            
            // Simulated visits to the website
            uniqueVisitors.add("visitor1@example.com");
            uniqueVisitors.add("visitor2@example.com");
            uniqueVisitors.add("visitor1@example.com"); // repeated visitor
            
            // Check presence of a visitor and print the result
            System.out.println(uniqueVisitors.contains("visitor3@example.com"));
        }
    }
