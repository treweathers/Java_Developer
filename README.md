# COURSE 1: Java Programming for Beginners

In Java, we use statements to perform actions, and each statement ends with a semicolon (;). Java employs curly braces ({ }) to define a block of code.

Look at this simple Java syntax example:

## 1. Java Syntax Basics
    
    class MyFirstProgram {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, Java World!");
        }
    }

In this example, we've declared a class `MyFirstProgram`, included the `main method`, which is where the program starts executing, and presented a statement that prints `"Hello, Java World!"`. You might not understand every single line of this code right now, but that's fine! We will cover it step-by-step in this and the next lessons.
