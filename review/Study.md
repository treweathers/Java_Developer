# WGU Java Study Guide: CodeSignal Certification Preparation
## Certification Overview
##### The CodeSignal Java certification evaluates your knowledge in core Java programming concepts. While the exam may change at any moment without notice, historically, you can expect four timed coding questions designed to test logic, problem-solving, and command of Java syntax. You will not be graded on style or comments, only on correctness and performance.

### Important Notes:
* Time: ~70 minutes
* Format: 4 coding problems
* Graded automatically on accuracy, efficiency, and test cases passed
* Difficulty: Ranges from basic to advanced

## Core Java Topics to Review
1. Data Types and Variables
* Primitive types: int, double, char, boolean, long, etc.
* Reference types: String, arrays, custom classes
* Type casting (implicit and explicit)
2. Control Flow
* if, else, switch
* while, for, do-while
* Enhanced for-loop (for-each)
* break, continue, and return
3. Arrays and Strings
* One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
* Common String methods: .length(), .charAt(), .substring(), .equals(), .split()
* Converting between Strings and arrays: .toCharArray(), String.join()
4. Methods and Scope
* Method declarations: return types, parameters
* Static vs. instance methods
* Pass-by-value behavior
* Method overloading
5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Classes and objects
* Constructors
* Inheritance (extends)
* Interfaces (implements)
* Method overriding vs overloading
* Polymorphism
6. Collections and Data Structures
* ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet
* Iteration using for, Iterator, or forEach
* Sorting: Collections.sort(), Arrays.sort()
* Comparing: Comparable vs Comparator
7. Algorithms and Problem Solving
* Searching: linear, binary
* Sorting: bubble, selection, insertion (know time complexity)
* Recursion and iteration
* Greedy and brute-force approaches

## Key Java Functions and Concepts
### Task Example
* Parse String to int int x = Integer.parseInt("123");
* Convert int to String String s = String.valueOf(123);
* Sort an array Arrays.sort(myArray);
* Use ArrayList ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
* Use HashMap HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
* Loop over array for (int i : arr) { }
* String equality "abc".equals("abc")
* Length of array arr.length
* Length of String str.length()
