Study Process
1. Review sheet of practice problems from course
2. Review Practice problems from AI
3. Practice practice problems

## 1\. Translating Code Problems (Logic --> Code)
* negative: i < 0
* even/odd: n % 2 == 0
* vowel: c == a | c == e | c == i | c == o | c == u
* first (anything): two-pointer problem (binary search)

## 2\. Code Format
1. edge case ðŸ†•
Strings
```java
if (str == null ||  str.isEmpty) {
    return -
}
```
Arrays
```java
if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) {
    throw -
}
```
2. filtering (case sensitivity, digits etc)
3. base code

Question Types
1. String 4/10
2. Arrays 5/10
3. Other 1/10
4. Debugging

Practice Problems (Assessment 1)
EASY
1. Fizz Buzz: Control flow and modulo operator (for loops, conditionals - continue inc.)
2. Reverse String
3. Max/Min Array
4. Count Even Numbers
MEDIUM
5. Count Vowels: character & string operations, for loops & conditionals
6. Sum Index Values: for loops & conditionals, indices
7. Palindrome Boolean
HARD
8. Remove Duplicates: O(1) complexity & "in-place" operations
EASY
9. OOP: Class and constructor and methods

Practice Problems (Assessment 2)
